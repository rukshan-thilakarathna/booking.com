### Interesting Features

- **Rapid Application Development** - Focus on PHP development and don't lose time with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Build application logic, not admin panels. Try the [quick start guide](https://orchid.software/en/docs/quickstart/) and kick-start the application's development.

- **Form Builder** - Prevent reinventing the wheel or forms. Orchid already supports many [form elements](https://orchid.software/en/docs/field/) "out of the box" and allows building all kinds of forms quickly.

- **Fast Loading Times** - Enjoy an SPA like performance! Transitions can be made without reloading a page and require no additional code. Thanks to the [Hotwire](https://hotwire.dev/) project, Orchid makes this a satisfying experience for both users and developers.

- **Access Permissions & Roles** - Take advantage of [granular access permissions](https://orchid.software/en/docs/access/), based on a user‚Äôs identity and corresponding role membership.

- **Filtering & Sorting** - Offer users the ability to filter and sort data quickly! Orchid uses an [Eloquent based filtering/sorting approach](https://orchid.software/en/docs/quickstart-sort-filter-table/).

- **Fast Full-Text Search** - Take advantage of the integrated [Laravel Scout based full-text search](https://orchid.software/en/docs/global-search/), which allows searching through all available content and displaying search results almost instantly.

- **Multiple Notifications Types** - Orchid offers [various types of notifications](https://orchid.software/en/docs/alert/) and allows the application to keep users informed appropriately.
